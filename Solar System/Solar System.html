    <p align="center">Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

        <h2>10 Need-to-Know Things About the Solar System </h2>
        <li>Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.</li>
        <li>Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.</li>
        <li>It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center. </li>
        <li>There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.</li>
        <li>Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds including Earth with many kinds of atmospheres.</li>
        <li>The planets of our solar system and even some asteroids hold more than 200 moons in their orbits.</li>
        <li>The four giant planets and at least one asteroid have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn’s gorgeous rings.</li>
        <li>More than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth's orbit, including 24 American astronauts who made the trip from the Earth to the Moon.</li>
        <li>Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re looking for more everywhere we can</li>
        <li>NASA’s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft to leave our solar system. Three other spacecraft Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons will eventually hit interstellar space.</li>
