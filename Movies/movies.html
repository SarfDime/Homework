                        <p>Six thugs, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss, Joe Cabot, to carry
                            out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with the intention
                            that they won't get too close and will concentrate on the job instead. They are completely
                            sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But, when the police show up right at the
                            time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members, and two of them
                            are killed in the subsequent shootout, along with a few policemen and civilians. When the
                            remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to
                            suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.</p>

                        <p>Truman Burbank is a normal man, living in a normal town. He grew up to be a desk clerk for a
                            insurance company, living an ordinary life, having an ordinary wife, an ordinary neighbour
                            and an ordinary bud, who pops in from time to time with a sixpack. But Truman is not happy
                            with his life. He wants to see the world. He wants to get away from his happy-happy, ever
                            tidy, nice'n'shiny little island town at the seaside. In reality, Truman was an unwanted
                            pregnancy. His "father", Christof, a reckless TV-Producer whom he never met, made up the
                            Truman Show - the greatest show on earth - a show in which life is live. So, everyone around
                            poor Truman is an actor with a little headphone in the ear. One day, Truman accidentally
                            bumps into a catering area backstage and gets pretty suspicious. His plan now is: Pretend to

                        <p>Bank Merchant Andy Dufresne is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, and
                            sentenced
                            to life imprisonment at Shawshank prison. Life seems to have taken a turn for the worse, but
                            fortunately Andy befriends some of the other inmates, in particular a character known only
                            as
                            Red. Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison,
                            leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can
                            never
                            be truly imprisoned.</p>
